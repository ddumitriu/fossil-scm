<title>Import And Export</title>

Fossil has the ability to import and export repositories from and to 
[http://git-scm.com/ | Git].  And since most other version control
systems will also import/export from Git, that means that you can 
import/export a Fossil repository to most version control systems using
Git as an intermediary.

<h2>Git &rarr; Fossil</h2>

To import a Git repository into Fossil, run commands like this:

<blockquote><pre>
cd git-repo
git fast-export --all | fossil import new-repo.fossil
</pre></blockquote>

In other words, simply pipe the output of the "git fast-export" command
into the "fossil import" command.  The 2nd argument to the "fossil import"
command is the name of a new Fossil repository that is created to hold the Git
content.

<h2>Fossil &rarr; Git</h2>

To convert a Fossil repository into a Git repository, run commands like
this:

<blockquote><pre>
git init new-repo
cd new-repo
fossil export -R ../repo.fossil | git fast-import
</pre></blockquote>

In other words, create a new Git repository, then pipe the output from the
"fossil export" commandn into the "git fast-import" command.

Note that the "fossil export" command only exports the versioned files.
Tickets and wiki and events are not exported, since Git does not understand
those concepts.
