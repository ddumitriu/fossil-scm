Customizing Fossil's Look
=========================

Every HTML page generated by Fossil has the following basic structure:


<blockquote><table border=1 cellpadding=10><tbody>
<tr><td style='background-color:lightblue;'>Header</td></tr>
<tr><td style='background-color:lightgreen;'>Content</td></tr>
<tr><td style='background-color:lightblue;'>Footer</td></tr>
</tbody></table></blockquote>

The header and footer control the "look" of Fossil pages.  Those
two sections can be customized separately for each repository to
develop a new theme.

The header will normally look something like this:

        <html>
        <head> ... </head>
        <body>
        ... top banner and menu bar ...
        <div class='content'>

And the footer will look something like this:

        </div>
        ... bottom material ...
        </body>
        </html>

The &lt;head&gt; element in the header will normally reference the
/style.css CSS file that Fossil stores internally.

The middle "content" section of Fossil-generated pages is not normally
customizable.  The appearance of Fossil is mostly governed by the CSS,
header, and footer, all of which are changeable on a per-repository
basis.  We call the bundle of built-in CSS, header, and footer a "skin".

Built-in Skins
--------------

Fossil comes with several built-in skins.  The sources to these built-ins can
be found in the Fossil source tree under the skins/ folder.  The skins/
folder contains a separate subfolder for each built-in skin, with each
subfolders holding three files, "css.txt", "footer.txt", and "header.txt",
that describe the CSS, footer, and header for that skin, respectively.

The skin of a repository can be changed to any of the built-in skins using
the web interface by going to the /setup_skin web page (requires Admin
privileges) and clicking the appropriate button.  Or, the --skin command
line option can be used for the 
[fossil ui](../../../help?cmd=ui) or
[fossil server](../../../help?cmd=server) commands to force that particular
instance of Fossil to use the specified built-in skin.

Sharing Skins
-------------

The skin of a repository is not part of the versioned state and does not
"push" or "pull" like checked-in files.  The skin is local to the 
repository.  However, skins can be shared between repositories using
the [fossil config](../../../help?cmd=configuration) command.
The "fossil config push skin" will send the local skin to a remote
repository and the "fossil config pull skin" command will import a skin
from a remote repository.  The "fossil config export skin FILENAME"
will export the skin for a repository into a file FILENAME.  This file
can then be imported into a different repository using the
"fossil config import FILENAME" command.  Unlike "push" and "pull",
the "export" and "import" commands are able to move skins between
repositories for different projects.  So, for example, if you have a
group of related repositories, you can develop a skin for one of them,
then get a consistent look across all the repositories by exporting
the skin from the first repository and importing into all the others.

The file generated by "fossil config export" could be checked into
one of your repositories and versioned, if desired.  This will not
automatically change the skin when looking backwards in time, but it
will provide an historical record of what the skin used to be and
allow the historical look of the repositories to be recreated if
necessary.

When cloning a repository, the skin of new repository is initialized to
the skin of the repository from which it was cloned.

Header And Footer
-----------------

The header.txt and footer.txt files of a scan are merely the HTML text
of the header and footer.  Except, that text is allowed to contain
embedded [TH1](./th1.md) script to modify or change its content.
With the header or footer, all text between &lt;th1&gt;...&lt;/th1&gt;
is run as a TH1 script.   And elements of the form &lt;$NAME&gt; are
replaced by the value of the NAME variable in TH1.

The same TH1 interpreter is used for both the header and the footer
and for all scripts contained within them both.  Hence, any global
TH1 variables that are set by the header are available to the footer.

TH1 Variables
-------------

Before expanding the TH1 within the header and footer, Fossil first
initializes a number of TH1 variables to values that depend on 
respository settings and the specific page being generated.

   *   **project_name** - The project_name variable is filled with the
       name of the project as configured under the Admin/Configuration
       menu.

   *   **title** - The title variable holds the title of the page being
       generated.  This variable is special in that it is deleted after
       the header script runs and before the footer script.  This is
       necessary to avoid a conflict with a variable by the same name used
       in my ticket-screen scripts.

   *   **baseurl** - The root of the URL namespace for this server.

   *   **secureurl** - The same as $baseurl except that if the scheme is
                       "http:" it is changed to "https:"

   *   **home** - The $baseurl without the scheme and hostname.  For example,
       if the $baseurl is "http://projectX.com/cgi-bin/fossil" then the
       $home will be just "/cgi-bin/fossil".

   *   **index_page** - The landing page URI as 
       specified by the Admin/Configuration setup page.

   *   **current_page** - The name of the page currently being processed,
       without the leading "/" and without query parameters.
       Examples:  "timeline", "doc/trunk/README.txt", "wiki".  

   *   **csrf_token** - A token used to prevent cross-site request forgery.

   *   **release_version** - The release version of Fossil.  Ex: "1.31"

   *   **manifest_version** - A prefix on the SHA1 check-in hash of the
       specific version of fossil that is running.  Ex: "\[47bb6432a1\]"

   *   **manifest_date** - The date of the source-code check-in for the
       version of fossil that is running.

   *   **compiler_name** - The name and version of the compiler used to
       build the fossil executable.

   *   **login** - This variable only exists if the user has logged in.
       The value is the username of the user.

   *   **stylesheet_url** - A URL for the internal style-sheet maintained
       by Fossil.

   *   **log\_image\_url** - A URL for the logo image for this project, as
       configured on the Admin/Logo page.

   *   **background\_image\_url** - A URL for a background image for this
       project, as configured on the Admin/Logo page.

All of the above are variables in the sense that either the header or the
footer is free to change or erase them.  But they should probably be treated
as constants.  New predefined values are likely to be added in future
releases of Fossil.
