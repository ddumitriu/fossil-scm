<title>Fossil Versus Git</title>

<h2>1.0 Don't Stress!</h2>

If you start out using one DVCS and later decide you like the other better,
it is [./inout.wiki | easy to change].

But it also helps to be informed about the differences between 
[http://git-scm.com | Git] and Fossil.  See the table below for
a high-level summary and the text that follows for more details.

Keep in mind that you are reading this on a Fossil website, 
so the information here
might be biased in favor of Fossil.  Ask around with people who have
used both Fossil and Git for other opinions.

<h2>3.0 Discussion</h2>

<h3>3.1 Feature Set</h3>

Git provides file versioning services only, whereas Fossil adds an
integrated [./wikitheory.wiki | wiki],
[./bugtheory.wiki | ticketing &amp; bug tracking],
[./embedddeddoc.wiki | embedded documentation], and
[./event.wiki | News/Blog features].
These additional capabilities are available for Git as 3rd-party
user-installed add-ons, but with Fossil they are integrated into
the design.  One way to describe Fossil is that it is
"[https://github.com/ | github]-in-a-box".

<h3>3.2 Sharding versus Replicating</h3>

Git makes it easy for each repository in a project to hold a subset of
the branches for that project.  In fact, it is entirely possible and not
uncommon for no repository in the project to hold all the different code
versions for a project.  Instead the information is distributed.  
Individual developers have one or more private branches.  A hierarchy
of integrators merge changes from individual developers into collaborative
branches, until all the changes are merged together at the top-level master
branch.  And all of this can be accomplished without having to have all the
code in any one repository.  Developers or groups of developers can share
only those branches that they want to share and keep other branchs of the
project private.  This is analogous to sharding an a distributed database.

Fossil allows private branches, but its default mode is to share everything.
And so in a Fossil project, all respositories tend to contain all of the
content at all times.  This is analogous to replication in a
distributed database.

The Git model works best for large projects, like the
Linux kernel for which Git was designed.
Linus Torvalds does not need or want to see a thousand
different branches, one for each contributor.  Git allows intermediary
"gate-keepers" to merge changes from multiple lower-level developers
into a single branch and only present Linus with a handful of branches
at a time.  Git encourages a programming model where each developer
works in his or her own branch and then merges changes up the hierarchy
until they reach the master branch.

Fossil is designed for smaller and non-hierarchical teams where all
developers are operating directly on the master branch, or at most
a small number of well defined branches.  
The [concepts.wiki#workflow | autosync] mode of Fossil makes it easy
for multiple developers to work on a single branch and maintain
linear development on that branch and avoid needless forking
and merging.

<h3>3.3 Community</h3>

Git has a huge user community.  If following the herd and being
like everybody else is important to you, then you should choose Git.

Fossil is clearly the "road less traveled":

<blockquote>
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I &#151;<br>
I took the one less traveled by,<br>
And that has made all the difference.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<small>- Robert Frost, <i>The Road Not Taken</i>, 1916</small>
</blockquote>
</i></blockquote>

Among the advantages of Git's huge user community are that new team
members may already be familiar with Git's operation and hence can
bypass the VCS learning curve.  Also, if you need an add-on tool or
script of some kind, a Google search will likely turn up a suitable
tool that you can just download and use.  A huge community also means
that somebody else has likely already encountered and fixed the bugs
so that Git will work for you and your project as advertised.

Among the advantages of the "road less traveled" is that your particular
project will be bigger percentage of the total user base, and is thus
more likely to receive personal attention from the Fossil maintainers 
if you do encounter problems.

<h3>3.4 Complexity</h3>

Git is a complex system.  It can be tricky to use and requires a fair
amount of knowledge and experience to master.  Fossil strives to be
a much simpler system that can be learned and mastered much more quickly.
Fossil strives to have fewer "gotchas" and quirks that can trip up a
developer.

The ideal VCS should just get out of the way of the developer and allow
the developer to focus 100% of their thinking on the project under
development.  One should not have to stop and think about how to operate
the VCS.  Of course, no VCS is ideal.  Every VCS requires the developer
to think about version control to some extent.  But one wants to minimize
the thinking about version control.

Git requires the developer to maintain a more complex mental model than
most other DVCSes.  Git takes longer to learn.  And you have to spend
more time thinking about what you are doing with Git.  

Fossil strives for simplicity.  Fossil wants to be easy to learn and to
require little thinking about how to operating it.  Reports from the
field indicate that Fossil is mostly successful at this effort.

<h3>3.5 Web Interface</h3>

Git has a web interface, but it requires a fair amount of setup and an
external web server.  Fossil comes with a fully functional
[./webui.wiki | built-in web-server]
and a really simple mechanism (the "<tt>fossil ui</tt>" command) to
automatically start the web server and bring up a web browser to navigate
it.  The web interface for Fossil is not only easier to set up, it is also
more powerful and easier to use.  The web interface to Fossil is a practical
replacement to the 3rd-party "GUI Tools" that users often employ to operate
Git.

<h3>3.6 Implementation Strategy</h3>

Git consists of a collection of many little programs.  Git needs to be
"installed" using some kind of installer or package tool.  Git can be
tricky to install and get working, especially for users without
administrative privileges.

Fossil is a single self-contained executable.  To "install" Fossil one
has merely to download a precompiled binary and place that binary
somewhere on $PATH.  To uninstall Fossil, simply delete the binary.
To upgrade Fossil, replace the old binary with a new one.

Fossil is designed to be trivial to install, uninstall, and upgrade so
that developers can spend more time working on their own projects and
much less time configuring their version control system.

<h3>3.7 Repository Storage</h3>

A Git repository is a "pile-of-files" in the ".git" directory at the
root of the working checkout.  There is a one-to-one correspondence
between repositories and working checkouts.  A power-loss or system crash
in the middle of Git operation can damage or corrupt the Git repository.

A Fossil repository consists of a single disk file.  A single Fossil
repository can serve multiple simultaneous working checkouts.
A Fossil repository is an SQLite database, so it highly resistant
to damage from a power-loss or system crash - incomplete transactions
are simply rolled back after the system reboots.

<h3>3.8 Audit Trail</h3>

Git features the "rebase" command which can be used to change the
sequence of check-ins in the repository.  Rebase can be used to "clean up"
a complex sequence of check-ins to make their intent easier for others
to understand.  From another point of view, rebase can be used to
"rewrite history" - to do what
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Smith | Winston Smith] did for
a living in Orwell's novel
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four | 1984].

Fossil deliberately avoids rewriting history.  Fossil strives to follow
the accountants philosophy of never erasing anything.  Mistakes are fixed
by entering a correction, with an explanation of why the correction is
needed.  This can make the history of a project messy, but it also
makes it more honest.  The lack of a "rebase" function is considered
a feature of Fossil, not a bug.

<h3>3.9 Single DAG</h3>

Git maintains a separate directed acyclic graph (DAG) for each branch
of a repository.  Fossil maintains a single DAG for all branches.  In
Git, the branch that a specific check-in belongs to is determined by
which DAG it is part of.  In Fossil, the branch of a check-in is determined
by [./branching.wiki#tags | tags and properties] attached to the check-in.

<h3>3.10 License</h3>

Both Git and Fossil are open-source.  Git is under 
[http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html | GPL] whereas Fossil is
under the 
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses | two-clause BSD license].
The difference should not be of a concern to most users.  However,
some corporate lawyers have objections to using GPL products and
are more comfortable with a BSD-style license.
