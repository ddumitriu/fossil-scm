<h1>Installing Fossil</h1>

<p>This page describes how to build and install Fossil.  The
whole process is designed to be very easy.</p>

<h2>1.0 Obtaining The Source Code</h2>

<p>Fossil is self-hosting, so you can obtain a ZIP archive containing
a snapshot of the latest version directly from fossil's own fossil
repository.  Follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Pointer your webbrowser at
<a href="http://fossil-scm.hwaci.com/fossil/login">
http://fossil-scm.hwaci.com/fossil/login</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>Log in as anonymous.  The password is shown on screen.
The reason for requiring this login is to prevent help spiders from
walking the walking the entire website, downloading ZIP archives
of every historical version, and thereby soaking up all our bandwidth.</p></li>

<li><p>Click on the 
<a href="http://fossil-scm.hwaci.com/fossil/timeline">Timeline</a> or
<a href="http://fossil-scm.hwaci.com/fossil/leaves">Leaves</a> link at
the top of the page.</p></li>

<li><p>Select a version of of fossil you want to download.  Click on its
link.  Note that you must successfully log in as "anonymous" in step 1
above in order to see the link to the detailed version information.</p></li>

<li><p>On the version information page, click on the
"Zip Archive" link.  This build a ZIP archive of the complete source
code and return it to your browser.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>2.0 Compiling</h2>

<p>Follow these stops to compile:</p>

<ol>
<li value="6">
<p>Create a directory to hold the source code.  Then unzip the
ZIP archive you downloaded into that directory.  You should be
in the top-level folder of that directory</p></li>

<li><p><b>(Optional:)</b>
Edit the Makefile to set it up like you want.  You probably do not
need to do anything.  Do not be intimidated:  There are only 5
variables in the makefile that can be changed.  The whole Makefile
is only a few dozen lines long and most of those lines are comments.</p>

<li><p>Type "<b>make</b>"
</ol>

<h2>3.0 Installing</h2>

<ol>
<li value="9">
<p>The finished binary is named "fossil".  Put this binary in a 
directory that is somewhere on your PATH environment variable.
It does not matter where.</p>

<li>
<p><b>(Optional:)</b>
To uninstall, just delete the binary.</p>
</ol>
