<p>This guide is intended to help guide you in setting up a Fossil server.</p>

<h2>Standalone server</h2><blockquote>
The easiest way to set up a Fossil server is to use the <tt>server</tt> or
<tt>ui</tt> command.  Assuming the repository you are interested in serving is
in the file "<tt>repo.fossil</tt>", you can use either of these commands to
start Fossil as a server:
<ul>
<li><tt>fossil server repo.fossil</tt>
<li><tt>fossil ui repo.fossil</tt>
</ul>

Both of these commands start a Fossil server on port 8080 on the local machine,
which can be accessed with the URL: <tt>http://localhost:8080/</tt> using any
handy web browser.  The difference between the two commands is that "ui", in
addition to starting the Fossil server, also starts a web browser and points it
to the URL mentioned above.

NOTE: the "--port NNN" option will start the server using port "NNN" instead of
8080.  Also, if port 8080 is already being used (perhaps by another Fossil
			 server), then Fossil will use the next available port number.
