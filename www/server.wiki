<p>This guide is intended to help guide you in setting up a Fossil server.</p>

<h2>Standalone server</h2><blockquote>
The easiest way to set up a Fossil server is to use the <tt>server</tt> or
<tt>ui</tt> command.  Assuming the repository you are interested in serving is
in the file "<tt>repo.fossil</tt>", you can use either of these commands to
start Fossil as a server:
<ul>
<li><tt>fossil server repo.fossil</tt>
<li><tt>fossil ui repo.fossil</tt>
</ul>

<p>
Both of these commands start a Fossil server on port 8080 on the local machine,
which can be accessed with the URL: <tt>http://localhost:8080/</tt> using any
handy web browser.  The difference between the two commands is that "ui", in
addition to starting the Fossil server, also starts a web browser and points it
to the URL mentioned above.
</p>
<p>
NOTES:
<ol>
<li>The option "--port NNN" will start the server on port "NNN" instead of 8080.  
<li>If port 8080 is already being used (perhaps by another Fossil server), then
Fossil will use the next available port number.
<li>Starting either command from within an "open" Fossil checkout will start a
server using the repository corresponding to the checkout.
</ol>
