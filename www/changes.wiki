  *  Background colors for branches are choosen automatically if no
     color is specified by the user.
  *  The status, changes and extras commands now show
     pathnames relative to the current working directory,
     unless overridden by command line options or the

<h2>Changes For Version 1.18 (2011-07-14)</h2>

  *  Added this Change Log

     subrepositories.

  *  In contexts where only a check-in makes sense, resolve branch and

     to take full advantage of this change.
  *  Update the built-in SQLite to version 3.7.7.
