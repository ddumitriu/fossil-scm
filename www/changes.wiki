<h2>Changes For Version 1.19 (2011-09-02)</h2>

  *  Added a ./configure script based on autosetup.
  *  Added the "[/help/winsrv | fossil winsrv]" command
     for creating a Fossil service on windows systems.
  *  Added "versionable settings" where settings that affect
     the local tree can be stored in versioned files in the
     .fossil-settings directory.
  *  Background colors for branches are choosen automatically if no
     color is specified by the user.
  *  The status, changes and extras commands now show
     pathnames relative to the current working directory,
     unless overridden by command line options or the
     "relative-paths" setting.<br><b>WARNING:</b> This
     change will break scripts which rely on the current
     output when the current working directory is not the
     repository root.
  *  Added "empty-dirs" versionable setting.
  *  Added support for client-side SSL certificates with "ssl-identity"
     setting and --ssl-identity option.
  *  Added "ssl-ca-location" setting to specify trusted root
     SSL certificates.
  *  Added the --case-sensitive BOOLEAN command-line option to many commands.
     Default to true for unix and false for windows.
  *  Added the "Color-Test" submenu button on the branch list web page.
  *  Compatibility improvements to the git-export feature.
  *  Performance improvements on SHA1 checksums
  *  Update to the latest SQLite version 3.7.8 alpha.
  *  Fix the tarball generator to work with very log pathnames

<h2>Changes For Version 1.18 (2011-07-14)</h2>

  *  Added this Change Log
  *  Added sequential version numbering
  *  Added a optional configure script - the Makefile still works for most
     systems.
  *  Improvements to the "annotate" algorithm: only search primary
     ancestors and ignore branches.
  *  Update the "scrub" command to remove traces of login-groups and
     subrepositories.
  *  Added the --type option to the "fossil tag find" command.
  *  In contexts where only a check-in makes sense, resolve branch and
     tag names to checkins only, never events or other artifacts.
  *  Improved display of file renames on a diff.  A rebuild is required
     to take full advantage of this change.
  *  Update the built-in SQLite to version 3.7.7.
