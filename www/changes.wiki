<h2>Changes For Version 1.24 (2012-10-22)</h2>
  *  Added support for WYSIWYG editing of wiki pages. WYSIWYG is turned off
     by default and can be turned on by setting a configuration option.
  *  Allow style= attribute to occur in HTML markup on wiki pages.
  *  Added the --tk option to the "fossi diff" and "fossil stash diff"
     commands, causing color-coded diff output to be displayed in a Tcl/Tk
     GUI window.  This option only works if Tcl/Tk is installed on the
     host.
  *  On windows, make the "gdiff" command default to use WinDiff.exe.
  *  Update the "fossil stash" command so that it always prompts for a
     comment if the -m option is omitted.
  *  Enhance the timeline webpages so that a=, b=, c=, d=, p=, and dp=
     query parameters (and others) can all accept any valid checkin name
     (such as branch names or labels) instead of just SHA1 hashes.
  *  Added the "fossil stash show" command.
  *  Added the "fileage" webpage with links to this page from the check-in
     information page and from the file browser.
  *  Added --age and -t options to the "fossil ls" command.
  *  Added the --setmtime option to "fossil update".  When used, the mtime
     of all mananged files is set to the time when the most recent version of
     the file was checked in.
  *  Changed the "vdiff" webpage to show the complete text of files that
     were added or removed (the equivelent of using the -N or --newfile
     options with the "fossil diff" command-line.)
  *  Added the --temp option to "fossil clean" and "fossil extra", causing
     those commands to only look at temporary files generated by Fossil,
     such as merge-conflict reports or aborted check-in messages.
  *  Enhance the raw page download so that it can guess the mimetype of
     attachments based on the filename.
  *  Change the behavior of the from= and to= query parameters on the
     timeline page so that by default the path between the two specified
     check-ins avoids merges.
  *  Add the --baseurl option to "fossil server" and "fossil http" commands,
     so that those commands can be used with reverse proxies.
  *  If unable to determine the command-line user, do not guess.  Instead
     issue an error message.  This helps prevent check-ins from accidentally
     occurring under the wrong username.
  *  Include branch information in the output of file change listings
     (the "finfo" webpage).
  *  Make the simplified view of file history, rather than the full view,
     the default.
  *  In the "fossil configuration" command, allow the "css" option for
     synchronizing, importing, or exporting just the CSS file.  This makes
     it easier to share CSS files across repositories by exporting from
     one and importing to another.
  *  Add the (unsupported) "fossil test-orphans" command.
  *  Add the --template option to the "fossil init" command, to facilitate
     creating new repositories based on a template repository.
  *  Add the diff-binary setting, which if enabled causes binary files to
     be passed to the "gdiff" command for it to deal with, rather than simply
     printing a "cannot diff binary files" error.
  *  Add the --unified option to the "fossil diff" command to force a unified
     diff even if the --tk option (which normally implies a side-by-side diff)
     is used.
  *  Present a choice of nearby branches and versions to diff against on the
     check-in information page.
  *  Add the --force option to the "fossil merge" command that will force the
     merge to occur even if it would be a no-op.  This is sometimes useful for
     documentation purposes.
  *  Add another built-in skin:  "Enhanced Default".  Other minor tweaks to
     the existing skins.
  *  Add the "urllist" webpage, showing a list of URLs by which a server
     instance of Fossil has been accessed.  Requires "Administrator" privileges.
     A link is on the "Setup" main page.
  *  Enable dynamic loading of the Tcl runtime for installations that want
     to use Tcl as part of their configuration.  This reduces the size of
     the Fossil binary and allows any version of Tcl 8.4 or later to be used.
  *  Merge the latest SQLite changes from upstream.
  *  Lots of minor bug fixes.

<h2>Changes For Version 1.23 (2012-08-08)</h2>
  *  The default checkout database name is now ".fslckout" instead of
     "_FOSSIL_" on unix.  Both names continue to work.
  *  Added the "fossil all changes" command
  *  Added the --ckout option to the "fossil all list" command
  *  Added the "public-pages" glob pattern that can be configured to allow
     anonymous users to see embedded documentation on sites where source
     code should not be accessible to anonymous users.
  *  Allow multiple --tag options on the same "fossil commit" command.
  *  Change the meaning of the --bgcolor option for "fossil commit" to only
     change the color for that one commit.  The new --branchcolor option 
     is available to set a persistent background color.
  *  Add the branch= query parameter to the vdiff page and the --branch option
     to the "fossil diff" command.
  *  Check-in names of the form "root:BRANCH" now refer to the origin of
     the branch.  Hence to see all changes in a branch, use 
     "fossil diff --from root:BRANCH --to BRANCH".  The --branch option on
     the diff command is an alias for the same.
  *  Add the ability to configure ad-units to be displayed between the menu
     bar and the content.
  *  Add the ability to set a background image as part of server configuration.
  *  Allow partial commits of cherrypick merges.
  *  Updates against an uncommitted merge are now a warning, not a fatal error.
  *  Prompt the user to continue if a check-in comment is unedited.
  *  Fixes to case sensitivity settings with the /dir webpage.
  *  Repositories now try to remember the locations of all checkouts and
     web-access URLs and display this information with the 
     "fossil info $REPO" command.
  *  Improved defense against spiders:  The src= attribute of
     &lt;a&gt; elements is set using javascript after the page loads.
  *  Enhanced formatting of the user list page.
  *  If a file named in "fossil add" is missing, that is now a warning instead
     of a fatal error.
  *  Fix side-by-side diff so that it displays correctly with 
     multi-byte UTF8 characters.
  *  Performance improvements in the diff logic.
  *  Other performance tweaks and documentation updates.

<h2>Changes For Version 1.22 (2012-03-17)</h2>
  *  Greatly improved "diff" processing including the new --brief option,
     partial line matching, colorized in-line diffs, and better performance.
  *  Promote "allow-symlinks" to a versionable setting
  *  Harden the CGI processing logic against DOS attacks
  *  Add the ability to run TH1 scripts after sync requests
  *  Store the repository name in _FOSSIL_ as it is type in the "open" command,
     possibly as a relative pathname.
  *  Make ".fslckout" the alternative name for the "_FOSSIL_" file. 
  *  Change the "ssh:" transfer method to allow all access regardless of
     user permission.
  *  Improvements to the timeline messages associated with tag changes.
     (Requires a "[/help/rebuild | fossil rebuild]" to take effect.)
  *  Various additions and fixes for the JSON API.
  *  Improved merge-with-rename handling.
  *  --cherrypick merges use their origin's commit message by default.
  *  Added support for multiple concurrent logins per user.
  *  Update to use SQLite version 3.7.11.
  *  Various minor bug fixes.

<h2>Changes For Version 1.21 (2011-12-13)</h2>
  *  Added side-by-side diffs in the command-line interface
  *  Automatically enable hyperlinks if the UserAgent string in the 
     HTTP header suggests that the requestor is a human and not a bot.
  *  Show only commonly used commands with "fossil help".  Use
     "fossil help --all" to see the complete list now.
  *  Improvements to the "stash" command:  (1) Stash all files, not just 
     those below the working directory. (2) Add the --detail option to 
     "list". (3) Confirm before "drop --all". (4) Add the "help" 
     subcommand.
  *  Add an Admin/Access setting to change the number of octets of the
     IP address that are saved in login cookies - allowing this setting
     to be changed to zero
  *  Promote the "test-md5sum" command to "md5sum".
  *  Added the "whatis" command.
  *  Stop showing the server-code in status outputs - it is no longer used
     for anything.
  *  Added a compile-time option (--with-tcl) to build in the full
     TCL interpreter to augment TH1.
  *  Merged the JSON branch into trunk.  Disabled by default.  Enabled
     by a compile-time option.  Probably it will be enabled by default
     in some future release.
  *  Update to use SQLite version 3.7.9 plus the alignment fix for Sparc.
