<h2>Changes For Version 1.18 (2011-07-14)</h2>

  *  Added this Change Log
  *  Added sequential version numbering
  *  Added a optional configure script - the Makefile still works for most
     systems.
  *  Improvements to the "annotate" algorithm: only search primary
     ancestors and ignore branches.
  *  Update the "scrub" command to remove traces of login-groups and
     subrepositories.
  *  Added the --type option to the "fossil tag find" command.
  *  In contexts where only a check-in makes sense, resolve branch and
     tag names to checkins only, never events or other artifacts.
  *  Improved display of file renames on a diff.  A rebuild is required
     to take full advantage of this change.
  *  Update the built-in SQLite to version 3.7.7.
