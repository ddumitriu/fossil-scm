<h1>Wiki In <a href="index.wiki">Fossil</a></h1>

Fossil uses <a href="../../../wiki_rules">wiki markup</a> for many
things:

   *  Stand-alone wiki pages.
   *  Description and comments in <a href="bugtheory.wiki">bug reports</a>.
   *  Check-in comments.
   *  <a href="embeddeddoc.wiki">Embedded documentation</a> files whose
      name ends in "wiki".

The <a href="../../../wiki_rules">formatting rules</a> for fossil wiki
are designed to be simple and intuitive.  The idea is that wiki provides
paragaph breaks, numbered and bulletted lists, and hyperlinking for
simple documents together with a safe subset of HTML for more complex
formatting tasks.

<h2>Stand-alone Wiki Pages</h2>

Each wiki page has its own revision history which is independent of
the sequence of baselines (check-ins).  Wiki pages can branch and merge
just like baselines, though as of this writing (2008-07-29) there is
no mechanism in the user interface to support branching and merging.
The current implementation of the wiki shows the version of the wiki
page that has the most recent timestamp.

In other words, if two users make unrelated changes to the same wiki
page on separate repositories, then those repositories are synced,
the wiki page will fork.  The web interface will display whichever edit
was checked in last.  The other edit can be found in the history.  The
file format will support merging the branches back together, but there
is no mechanism in the user interface (yet) to perform the merge.

Every change to a wiki page is a separate 
<a href="fileformat.wiki">control artifact</a> 
of type <a href="fileformat.wiki#wikichng">"Wiki Page"</a>.
