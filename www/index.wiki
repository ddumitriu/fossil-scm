<h1>Fossil: Distributed Revision Control, Wiki, and Bug-Tracking</h1>

Fossil is a
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control | distributed software version control system]
that includes an integrated
[./wikitheory.wiki | distributed wiki] and an integrated
[./bugtheory.wiki | distributed bug-tracking system] all in a single, 
easy-to-use, stand-alone executable.
Fossil is [http://www.fossil-scm.org/ | self-hosting]
since 2007-07-21 on
[http://www.hwaci.com/cgi-bin/fossil | two separate servers].
You can download the [/timeline?y=ci | latest sources] and
[./build.wiki | compile it yourself].
Or you can grab
[http://www.fossil-scm.org/download.html | pre-compiled binaries].


Feature Summary:

  *  Flexible workflow:<ul>
    <li>Disconnected, distributed development like
      <a href="http://kerneltrap.org/node/4982">git</a>,
      <a href="http://www.monotone.ca/">monotone</a>,
      <a href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi">mercurial</a>,
      and <a href="http://www.bitkeeper.com/">bitkeeper</a>
    <li>Or, client/server operation like 
      <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/">CVS</a> and
      <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">subversion</a>,
    <li>Or, operations on local repositories,
    <li>Or, all of the above at the same time</ul>
  *  Integrated, [./bugtheory.wiki | distributed bug tracking] and 
     [./wikitheory.wiki | distributed wiki].
  *  Built-in web interface that supports deep archaeological digs through
     the project history.
  *  All network communication via 
     [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP | HTTP] with 
     [./quickstart.wiki#proxy | proxy support]
     so that everything works from behind restrictive firewalls.
  *  Everything (client, server, and utilities) is included in a 
     single self-contained executable - trivial to install
  *  Server runs as [./quickstart.wiki#cgiserver | CGI], using
     [./quickstart.wiki#inetdserver | inetd/xinetd]
     or using its own 
     [./quickstart.wiki#serversetup | built-in, stand alone web server].
  *  An entire project contained in single disk file
     (an [http://www.sqlite.org/ | SQLite] database.)
  *  Uses an [./fileformat.wiki | enduring file format] that is 
     designed to be readable, searchable, and extensible by people
     not yet born.
  *  Automatic [./selfcheck.wiki | self-check]
     on repository changes makes it exceedingly
     unlikely that data will ever be lost because of a software bug.
  *  Ridiculously easy to [./build.wiki | install] and 
     [./quickstart.wiki | operate].
