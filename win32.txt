Notes: Porting fossil to win32
======================================================================

Setting up my build environment:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

  Install:
    MinGW 5.1.3
    MSYS  1.0.10
  
  Download/compile/install zlib (configure --prefix=/mingw)
  Download/compile/install tclsh (configure --prefix=/) (for tests)
  
  All commands were issued in the MSYS shell, not a cmd.exe



Outstanding Issues:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

* server is totally non-functional - #if/#end'd out of the code
* all path operations are defunct
* remote network operations are reporting: can't resolve host name: xyz
  
  Winsock must be initialized before using:
  
      WSADATA info;
      if (WSAStartup(MAKEWORD(1,1), &info) != 0){
        fossil_panic("can't initialize winsock");
      }

#1 Have a repo where I removed a file. I did a fossil checkout 123abc,
   which is the last version that had the file. The file does not
   appear. fossil checkout --force 123abc does things, but still the
   file does not appear.
   
   Make a new dir, fossil open ../repo.fsl && fossil checkout 123abc and
   the file appears.
   
   Is that normal operation?

#2 No socket operations are functioning yet

#3 In test1/ I edited a file, test2/ I updated, type file.txt changes
   were there. I then did fossil undo file.txt. The changes were gone
   and fossil status said I had edited file.txt. A fossil redo did not
   print anything to the screen and the changes for file.txt are not
   in the file. fossil status still reports that the file was edited.
   There was no commit/update or any other command inbetween these
   actions.

#4 There were various difficulties in this function beyond simple socket
   problems. The major one being fork. This will probably be the last
   command to be functional in fossil on windows.
