Fossil on Win32
======================================================================

Setting up the build environment:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

  Install:
    MinGW 5.1.3
    MSYS  1.0.10
  
  Download/compile/install zlib (configure --prefix=/mingw)
  Download/compile/install tclsh (configure --prefix=/) (for tests)
  
  Installing zlib and tclsh was done in the MSYS shell so I could
  easily use the configure scripts. Tcl is only required to run the
  tests. You could install a binary distribution of Tcl/Tk and use
  that to run the tests, or you could opt to simply trust that 
  everything worked and not run the tests.
  
  There is a contributed zlib package on the MinGW site. 
  
  Downloading and installing a binary Tcl/Tk package and the 
  contributed zlib package would remove the requirement of MSYS.
  

Building on Windows:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

  Ensure you have read "Setting up the build environment" first.
  
  Building is as simple as one command:
  
      C:\fossil-src> make -f Makefile.w32


Outstanding Issues:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

* server is totally non-functional - #if/#end'd out of the code

#1 Have a repo where I removed a file. I did a fossil checkout 123abc,
   which is the last version that had the file. The file does not
   appear. fossil checkout --force 123abc does things, but still the
   file does not appear.
   
   Make a new dir, fossil open ../repo.fsl && fossil checkout 123abc and
   the file appears.
   
   Is that normal operation?

#3 In test1/ I edited a file, test2/ I updated, type file.txt changes
   were there. I then did fossil undo file.txt. The changes were gone
   and fossil status said I had edited file.txt. A fossil redo did not
   print anything to the screen and the changes for file.txt are not
   in the file. fossil status still reports that the file was edited.
   There was no commit/update or any other command inbetween these
   actions.

#4 There were various difficulties in this function beyond simple socket
   problems. The major one being fork. This will probably be the last
   command to be functional in fossil on windows.
