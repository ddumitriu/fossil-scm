All of the source code for fossil is contained in the src/ subdirectory.
But there is a lot of generated code, so you will probably want to
use the Makefile.  To do a complete build, just type:

   make

That should work out-of-the-box on Macs and Linux systems. If you are
building on a Windows box, install MinGW as well as MinGW's make (or
MSYS). You can then type:

   make -f Makefile.w32

If you have trouble, or you want to do something fancy, just look at
top level makefile. There are 6 configuration options that are all well
commented. Instead of editing the Makefile, consider copying the Makefile
to an alternative name such as "GNUMakefile", "BSDMakefile", or "makefile"
and editing the copy.

Out of source builds?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

An out of source build is pretty easy:

  1. Make a new directory to do the builds in.
  2. Copy "Makefile" from the source into the build directory and
  modify the SRCDIR macro along the lines of:

    SRCDIR=../src

  3. type: "make"

This will now keep all generates files seperate from the maintained
source code.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here are some notes on what is happening behind the scenes:

* The Makefile just sets up a few macros and then invokes the
  real makefile in src/main.mk.  The src/main.mk makefile is
  automatically generated by a TCL script found at src/makemake.tcl.
  Do not edit src/main.mk directly.  Update src/makemake.tcl and
  then rerun it.

* The *.h header files are automatically generated using a program
  called "makeheaders".  Source code to the makeheaders program is
  found in src/makeheaders.c.  Documentation is found in 
  src/makeheaders.html.

* Most *.c source files are preprocessed using a program called
  "translate".  The sources to translate are found in src/translate.c.
  A header comment in src/translate.c explains in detail what it does.

* The src/mkindex.c program generates some C code that implements
  static lookup tables.  See the header comment in the source code
  for details on what it does.
