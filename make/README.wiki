The makefile fragments in this "new build" directory are of three kinds:

  *  Platform fragments for OS-specific settings. (e.g.
     <code>linux-fragment.mk</code>);
  *  Compiler fragments for compiler-specific settings (e.g.
     <code>clang-fragment.mk</code>);
  *  Sample <code>pre-config.mk</code> fragments to use as a baseline for
     site-specific customization of the build process (e.g.
     <code>linuxgcc-pre-config.mk</code>.

Platform and compiler fragments should not be edited at site except to correct
errors in implementation or to add desirable new features so that clashes with
the <cite>Fossil</cite> repository don't interfere with operations. Where
possible all site customization should be done in pre- and post-config makefile
fragments. (Where this is not possible is probably indicative of modifications
required to the new build process.

To use the sample pre-config fragments, simply copy them into the
<cite>Fossil</cite> distribution's root directory as <code>pre-config.mk</code>
and edit to taste.

Note: new platform and compiler files are always welcome additions to the
community. In particular MacOSX and BSD builds would be nice to have.
