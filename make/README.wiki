The makefile fragments in this "new build" directory are used to provide
platform-specific builds out-of-the-box with minimal user intervention. They are
named as <code>PLATFORM-COMPILER-config.mk</code> and are used by copying them
into the <cite>Fossil</cite> distribution root directory as
<code>config.mk</code>.

The file <code>linux-gcc-config.mk</code> is the default make file fragment
brought in by the main <code>Makefile</code> if no <code>config.mk</code> file
has been copied.

Note: new platform and compiler files are always welcome additions to the
community. In particular MacOSX build files would be nice to have as well as
alternative compilers.
