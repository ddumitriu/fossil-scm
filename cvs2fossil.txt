Known problems and areas to work on
===================================

*	Not yet able to handle the specification of multiple projects
	for one CVS repository. I.e. I can, for example, import all of
	tcllib, or a single subproject of tcllib, like tklib, but not
	multiple sub-projects in one go.

*	We have to look into the pass 'InitCsets' and hunt for the
	cause of the large amount of memory it is gobbling up.
