Known problems and areas to work on
===================================

*	Not yet able to handle the specification of multiple projects
	for one CVS repository. I.e. I can, for example, import all of
	tcllib, or a single subproject of tcllib, like tklib, but not
	multiple sub-projects in one go.

*	An internal error thrown when trying to import bwidget of
	tcllib shows that there have to be some situation I am not
	handling correctly in the cycle-breaker and sorting passes.

	It tries to import a changeset on the
	'scriptics-sc-2-0-beta-branch' line of development (X), which
	has no commits yet. So it goes to the parent LOD to get the
	state we are spawning from. This parent is
	'scriptics-sc-1-1-branch' (Y). And is has no changesets
	committed to it yet. That should not be possible, the ordering
	constraints should have put all changesets for Y before the
	changesets of X, and Y had to have at least one changeset,
	from which the branch could be spawned.

	This need deep diving into the various linkages to understand
	what is happening, or not happening, depending.

	Note: The code I had before more fully tracking the workspace
	      state of the various lods wrongly slid over this problem
	      without erroring out.
